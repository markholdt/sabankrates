            <h1>How to find the best fixed deposit rates</h1>
            <p>
              Back in August of 2019, I found myself with some savings I was hoping to use for a car purchase in about 6 months.
              I have some cash which I would like to put on fixed deposit.
              Let's find ourselves the best fixed deposit rates!

            <h4>Step 1: Head over to fnb.co.za</h4>
            <p>I like FNB. I love what they have done in the market & how digital their product offerings are. So I visit their website with a positive mindset.</p>

            <p>Eu quo homero blandit intellegebat. Incorrupte consequuntur mei id. Mei ut facer dolores adolescens, no illum aperiri quo, usu odio brute at. Qui te porro electram, ea dico facete utroque quo. Populo quodsi te eam, wisi everti eos ex, eum elitr altera utamur at. Quodsi convenire mnesarchum eu per, quas minimum postulant per id.</p>

          <p>I work in the finance industry. I have the relevant degrees.</p>
          <p>Yet, I was unable to understand the rates I was being offered. Primarily due to a lack of disclosure on the banks' websites.</p>
